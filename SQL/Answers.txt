Question 1

SELECT * FROM runners WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT winner_id FROM races)

The result of the above query will return an empty set because the data set is being evaluated by the NOT IN conditon where races table contains a colomn with winner_id of null value.
The null value affects the outcome of the NOT IN operator. 
To avoid this, We will have to use IS NOT NULL operators instead : 

SELECT * FROM runners WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT winner_id FROM races WHERE winner_id IS NOT null)

Question 2

SELECT Name FROM Customers WHERE ReferredBy <> 2

The above query will return Pat Richards only. In SQL, not equal operator is used to check whether two expressions are equal or not. 
If it’s not equal then condition will be true and it will return not matched records.

To get the desired results we can excuted the below query:-

SELECT Name FROM Customers WHERE ReferredBy IS NULL OR ReferredBy <> 2
